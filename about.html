          After working as an art historian and writer for many years, 
          I retrained as a product designer and started working primarily 
          with clay twelve years ago. Gradually my focus has shifted from 
          making wheel-thrown functional ware and groups of bottles and 
          vases in porcelain to working more experimentally. After completing 
          the City Lit Ceramic Diploma course in 2019, I am presently studying 
          for an MA (2019-2021, Ceramics & Glass) at the Royal College of Art 
          in London.

          In my practice I am interested in fragments and the fragmentary - 
          in the way past events surface and leave traces in the here and now. 
          I am fascinated by the way we inhabit and relate to different 
          temporalities, from ever-changing reflections on water to the time 
          of geological strata or, in human history, seemingly timeless 
          architectural elements and structures which are continuously 
          reconfigured in the service of changing technologies. The emphasis 
          in my work on fragments and process allows me to explore questions 
          relating to experiences of loss, displacement and uncertainty, 
          the role of memory, and how we reimagine a sense of belonging and 
          of self.
